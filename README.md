# expenses_viewer

Data dashboard tool made to look at travel expenses claimed in a previous job I worked at, created using JavaScript and the Google Charts API.

A full working version of the tool, loaded with dummy data, can be viewed [here](https://codingpangolin.github.io/expenses_viewer/app_main.html).
